    "\n",
    "In this project our task is to extend sentences from abstracts fetched from PubMed. To solve this problem we decided to use a recurrent neural network (RNN) because such networks are good at solving this kind of task. After training the network on sequences of words it can be used to extend such sentences. In short<sup>[1](#fn1)</sup>, the network takes a number of words as input and then predicts the next word in that sequence. We can then append the predicted word to the original sequence and input that into the network again and repeat this process to predict an arbitrary number of words. In order to implement such a network, we used [Keras](https://keras.io/) from [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The task can be divided into obtaining datasets, preparing the datasets for input to the RNN, constructing and training the RNN and finally making predictions. During our testing, we try find a good model<sup>[2](#fn2)</sup> by training the network independently on different datasets, changing preparation stages and tweaking parameters. We then compare our models in the [Evaluation](#evaluation) section.\n",

      "[DEBUG] Main: First extracted abstract: Background: Surgical resection is frequently the recommended treatment for drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), yet many factors play a role in patients' perceptions of brain surgery that ultimately impact decision-making. The purpose of the current study was to explore how people with epilepsy, in their own words, experienced the overall process of consenting to surgery for drug-resistant TLE. Methods and Materials: Data was drawn from in-person, semi-structured interviews of 19 adults with drug-resistant TLE eligible to undergo epilepsy surgery. A systematic thematic analysis was performed to code, sort and compare participant responses. The mean age of these 12 (63%) women and seven (37%) men was 37.6 years (18-68 years), with average duration of epilepsy of 13 years (2-30 years). Results: Meeting the neurosurgeon and consenting to surgery represented an important treatment milestone across a prolonged treatment trajectory. Four themes were identified: (1) Understanding the language of risk; (2) Overcoming risk; (3) Family-centered, shared decision-making, and (4) Building decisional-confidence. Conclusion: Despite living with the restrictions of chronic uncontrolled seizures, considering an elective brain procedure raised unique and complex questions. Personal beliefs and expectations related to treatment outcomes influenced how the consent process was ultimately experienced. Decisions to pursue surgery had frequently been made ahead of meeting the surgeon, with many describing the act of signing as personally empowering. Overall, satisfaction was expressed with the information provided during the surgical visit, despite later inaccurate recall of the facts. These findings support the resultant recommendation that the practice of informed consent be conceptualized as a systematic, structured interdisciplinary process which occurs over time and encompasses three stages: preparation, signing and follow-up after signing.\n",

    "This section is the final step to achieve our goal. We load our Keras model and it's corresponding tokenizer and use it to make predictions. The routine given here takes arbitrary user input but for best results we recommend to supply input from the learning domain or at least the general bio-medical field (as PubMed is mainly a bio-medical database). It then generates words until it predicts a sentence delimiter (.?!) or a timeout occurs (in that case it predicts a fixed number of words). Since predictions will never be 100% accurate, the model does not always predict a sentence delimiter within a reasonable amount of time. In a more comprehensive solution one could change this to something like a method that relies on an HMM classifier to find a suitable end of the sentence and add punctuation accordingly and skip predicting punctuation entirely. The word that is selected for prediction from the output distribution of the network can be chosen by either appyling argmax to the output directly (can cause loops) or by picking from the probability distribution with a certain randomness (probabilities are still taken into account). We opted for the latter in this implementation."

The validation accuracy is roughly between 20% and 27% for the sizes > 100 abstracts and the greatest val_acc is achieved by the dataset with only 200 abstracts after 92 epochs with 26.98%. We also tested models trained on small datasets with <50 abstracts, which achieve really high validation accuracies and low loss values but the vocabulary of these models is quite limited and they don't generalize well compared to the models trained on more data.\n",

    "The best model was the one trained on 2000 abstracts again, the val_loss was lowered to 'only' 5.402 and the val_acc stayed about the same with 22.31%. We suspect that more general queries decrease the performance on predictions related to specific parts of the topic but increase the performance on predictions regarding a broader spectrum of the topic. This would mean that narrowing down the query for a really specific subject does not necessarily mean better models in every case since at some point the model is only really useful for very specific input data. A good middle ground between fitting to the data and generalization has to be found in that regard, which could be achieved by testing and evaluating the actual predictions by hand and picking the best model according to the requirements of the application.\n",

    "Lastly, we tried using the previous queries combined to possibly enable predictions for broader topics. As expected, the val_loss and val_acc values are significantly worse than most models we tried so far. Since our baseline network only has 256 neurons in the hidden layers in total it is quite possible that increasing the amount of LSTM and dense nodes will allow for more learning parameters and therefore more 'learning capacity'. The best models we tested so far seem limited to about 30% val_acc and 5.4 val_loss, which might be caused by the small number of neurons 'bottlenecking' performance. With more neurons, more general and multiple queries as a base for the dataset probably yield models that are a lot better; due to our limited computing capacity and time we will not pursue that direction further here though.\n"
