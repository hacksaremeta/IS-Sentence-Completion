      "[DEBUG] Main: First extracted abstract: Background: Surgical resection is frequently the recommended treatment for drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), yet many factors play a role in patients' perceptions of brain surgery that ultimately impact decision-making. The purpose of the current study was to explore how people with epilepsy, in their own words, experienced the overall process of consenting to surgery for drug-resistant TLE. Methods and Materials: Data was drawn from in-person, semi-structured interviews of 19 adults with drug-resistant TLE eligible to undergo epilepsy surgery. A systematic thematic analysis was performed to code, sort and compare participant responses. The mean age of these 12 (63%) women and seven (37%) men was 37.6 years (18-68 years), with average duration of epilepsy of 13 years (2-30 years). Results: Meeting the neurosurgeon and consenting to surgery represented an important treatment milestone across a prolonged treatment trajectory. Four themes were identified: (1) Understanding the language of risk; (2) Overcoming risk; (3) Family-centered, shared decision-making, and (4) Building decisional-confidence. Conclusion: Despite living with the restrictions of chronic uncontrolled seizures, considering an elective brain procedure raised unique and complex questions. Personal beliefs and expectations related to treatment outcomes influenced how the consent process was ultimately experienced. Decisions to pursue surgery had frequently been made ahead of meeting the surgeon, with many describing the act of signing as personally empowering. Overall, satisfaction was expressed with the information provided during the surgical visit, despite later inaccurate recall of the facts. These findings support the resultant recommendation that the practice of informed consent be conceptualized as a systematic, structured interdisciplinary process which occurs over time and encompasses three stages: preparation, signing and follow-up after signing.\n",

Decisions to pursue surgery had frequently been made ahead of meeting the surgeon , with many describing the act of signing as personally empowering . Overall , satisfaction was expressed with the information provided during the surgical visit , despite later inaccurate recall of the facts . These findings support the resultant recommendation that the practice of informed consent be conceptualized as a systematic , structured interdisciplinary process which occurs over time and encompasses three stages : preparation , signing and follow-up after signing . \n",
